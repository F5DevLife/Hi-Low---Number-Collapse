### Number-Collapse

* Number Collapse is a game where you guess a number between 1 and 100.
* Currently, it tracks how many attempts it takes you to get the correct number.
  * I am considering limiting to how many tries you get to make it challenging.
* This will likely go into a mix of mini-games, [Gamble](https://github.com/F5DevLife/Gamble), I'm also working on.
